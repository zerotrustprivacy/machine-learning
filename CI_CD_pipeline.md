# Here are the steps that I used to create a CI/CD pipeline for Machine Learning model deployment:
# To start, there were a few things that I needed:
## Cloud Source Repositories (or GitHub/GitLab): Your code repository.
## Cloud Build: The CI/CD service that orchestrates the pipeline steps.
## Artifact Registry: To store your Docker images.
## Vertex AI (Model Registry & Endpoints): To register and deploy your model.

## The script that I will use is the train_model.py
